2. Standby
3. 3.. 2... 1..
4. Hit the play button

### First 5 mins
1. Keep headphones off for the first 5 minutes
2. Look at characters first - if THEY DO NOT raise their hands you need to get them a new phone, switch it to performer mode and select their characters
3. Look for audience members with their hands up. If they need a new phone, bring one to them and make sure it's set to audience mode. You can tell this by just clicking around the characters. 
4. Check for phones with no headphones plugged in. There should be an eerie silene in the room

## In Between Shows
1. Press RESET
2. Walk around and check that all phones are at 0 and that no characters are selected on the screen. Also check if any of the phones are in admin mode (you'll see a play and stop button). Finally, check that none of the phones have a flashing red light indicating that they're out of battery
3. For those that are still playing or in admin mode, swap them out with one of the spares whilst you look at them more closely
4. Put all of the swapped out phones into audience mode and press RESET again.
5. If there's time, do another Test Play and repeat the preperation checks

## Post-Show
Make sure each phone is off.
Plug each USB mini cable into the phone. 
Place phones in the box in nice straight lines.
Plug each USB plug into a charging slot.
When a phone is charging, it's LED light on the front corner should light up. Green - full charge, Orange - half charge, Red - low charge, Flashing Red - critical charge
Once all the phones are plugged in, inspect each one to ensure that they are charging and that the power is off. If you tap (not hold) the power button when a phone is charging, it should bring up the battery screen. Tap again to dim the screen. 
If a phone is cycling between the battery screen, startup screen and dim screen, or the phone doesn't seem to be charging at all, remove the battery and the USB cable and wait for 5 seconds then replace them and try again. 

The master USB plug (blue in the case of the big octopus) has to be plugged into a computer USB port for charging to occur!

The little buttons with the LEDs on the USB hubs are power switches. Make sure they're all on!
